# Zetsy

This challenge asks you to build the Zetsy page by writing your own HTML & CSS from scratch to match the mockup image and/or the live site example.

## Steps

## Tasks for LearnIDE Environment Users

1. Click the "OPEN IDE" button

## Tasks for Local Environment Users

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. `cd` into the local repo you just cloned.

## Process
1. Open the MOCKUP.jpg image and take a look at it.
2. Use the text and suggested images listed in SOURCE.md to fill in the content for index.html.
3. Then use css/style.css to write the CSS code necessary to make your your site page look like the example shown in MOCKUP.jpg. You can eye-drop colors using [Digital Color Meter App](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/discover-the-digitalcolor-meter-tool-on-your-mac/#) if you are using OSX, or a program like [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) for Windows. If you get stuck you can use the Developer Tools to inspect the code at the live site example here: [Zetsy live page example](http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/fe-zetsy/)
4. BONUS: Add CSS transitions for the mouse hover events. See: [http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)
